<!-- ABOUT -->
## About

This repository demonstrates form validation techniques with HTML 5 built-in attributes and the parsley.js library.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting started

Git clone this repository to a local repository. This will give you access to all the files. Once downloaded, you can access three example projects.

The first, works through the process flow for submitting a custom [order](./order/) for "Davie's Burgers." To start, open the `login.html` file to kick start the form workflow. This will prompt you for email and password input... there is logic involved to validate your entry but you can put in whatever you'd like as long as it abids by form requirements. You'll know what they are if you make a mistake! 😉... Once you get past the login screen, you'll be directed to the form via `order.html`. Submit your order for a burger 🍔 and you'll find success at `success.html`! (⌐■_■)

The second project provides a [madlibs](./madlibs/) game based off the classic story: The Tortoise and the Hare. You can kick off the form process via `madlibs.html` and follow instructions to pass on your responses for the story which will be formatted and output to the `story.html` file via `story.js`. For reference, you will be able to see the `original.html` story. But if you're having too much fun, there is the option to start over and make another `madlibs.html`. 👈(ﾟヮﾟ👈)

The last demo provides a search form for [books](./books/) and their associated meta data. The search form can be accessed via `books.html` and if search results exist, they will be loaded via JS to the DOM.
